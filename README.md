# Treehouse PHP Project 5  
In this project, you will build your own Pet Adoption web application using Laravel. The main (index) page will display a featured pet banner followed by images of both dogs and cats. Each pet entry uses the Unsplash Source API to generate dog and cat images. Your completed Laravel application should have the same functionality as the static website but feel free to change the colors to match your personal style, if you feel comfortable working with Bootstrap.
